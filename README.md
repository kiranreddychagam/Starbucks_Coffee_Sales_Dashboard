# Starbucks_Coffee_Sales_Dashboard
In this project, I developed an interactive dashboard using coffee orders data to provide insightful visualizations and data analysis. The project involved cleaning and sorting the raw data using Excel functions like IF, XLOOKUP, and INDEXMATCH to ensure accuracy and relevance.

I employed a Pivot Table to efficiently analyze the data and create dynamic visualizations that highlight key metrics such as total orders, sales trends, and customer preferences. Additionally, I customized the Pivot Chart Timeline and Slicer templates to enhance the dashboard's user experience, allowing for seamless filtering and time-based analysis.

This dashboard not only offers an intuitive interface for data exploration but also serves as a powerful tool for making informed business decisions based on real-time insights.
